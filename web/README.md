# NBA EDI Dashboard

This is the frontend for the NBA Enhanced Defensive Index (EDI) project.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

3.  **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The static output will be in the `out` directory.

## Data Source

The data is loaded from `public/data.json`, which is generated by the Python backend (`src/web_export.py`).

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project is configured for static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`).

To deploy to GitHub Pages, you can use a GitHub Action that builds this directory and deploys the `out` folder.

### Example GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

```yaml
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./web
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: web/package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./web/out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
